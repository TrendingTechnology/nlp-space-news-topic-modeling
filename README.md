## [Project Idea](#project-idea)

### [Project Overview](#project-overview)
This project aims to learn topics published in Space news from the [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/science) (UK) news publication.

## [Motivation](#motivation)
The model/tool would give an idea of what Space news topics matter to each publication over time. For example, a space mission led by the European Space Agency (ESA) might be more relevant/important to the Guardian than to the New York Times. The two news publications<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup> list articles on their web pages and machine learning is deployed to learn topics from this news articles.

<a name="myfootnote1">1</a>: articles were also retrieved from the blog Space.com and from the Hubble Telescope news archive, but these data sources were not used in analysis

## [Data acquisition](#data-acquisition)
### [Primary data source](#primary-data-source)
Data is acquired from the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/section/science/space) (US) but is not used in topic modeling.

News articles are retrieved using the official API provided by the [Guardian](https://open-platform.theguardian.com/).

### [Supplementary data sources](#supplementary-data-sources)
Data is also acquired from articles published by the Hubble Telescope, the New York Times (US) and blog publication Space.com
- [Hubble News API](http://hubblesite.org/api/documentation)
- [New York Times](https://developer.nytimes.com/)
- [Space.com](https://www.space.com/)

Although these articles were acquired, they were not used in analysis.

### [Data file creation](#data-file-creation)
1. Use `1_get_list_of_urls.ipynb`
   - programmatically retrieves urls from API or archive of publication
   - retrieves metadata such as date and time, section, sub-section, headline/abstract/short summary, etc.
2. Use `2_scrape_urls.ipynb`
   - scrapes news article text from publication url
3. Use `3_merge_scraped_and_filter.ipynb`
   - merge metadata (`1_get_list_of_urls.ipynb`) with scraped article text (`2_scrape_urls.ipynb`)

## [Analysis](#anlysis)
Analysis will be performed using an un-supervised learning model. Details are included in the various notebooks in the root directory and listed [below](#usage).

## [Usage](#usage)
1. Clone this repository
   ```bash
   $ git clone
   ```
2. Create Python virtual environment, install packages and launch interactive Python platform
   ```bash
   $ make build
   ```
3. Run notebooks in the following order
   - `3_merge_scraped_and_filter.ipynb` ([view](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/edesz/nlp-space-news-tpoic-modeling/blob/master/3_merge_scraped_and_filter.ipynb)) (covers data from the Hubble news feed, New York Times and Space.com)
     - merge multiple files of articles text data retrieved from news publications API or archive
     - filter out articles of less than 500 words
     - export to `*.csv` file for use in unsupervised machine learning models
   - `8_gensim_coherence_nlp_trials_v2.ipynb` ([view](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/edesz/nlp-space-news-topic-modeling/blob/master/8_gensim_coherence_nlp_trials_v2.ipynb)) (does not cover data from the Hubble news feed, New York Times and Space.com)
     - experiments in selecting number of topics using
       - coherence score from built-in coherence model to score Gensim's NMF
       - `sklearn`'s implementation of TFIDF + NMF, using best number of topics found using Gensim's NMF
     - manually reading articles that NMF associates with each topic
     - qualitative assessment of cosine similarities for inter-topic news articles
4. Run CI build with
   ```bash
   make ci
   ```
